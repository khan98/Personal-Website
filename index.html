                <h2>WELCOME!</h2>
                <p>Hi! As you've probably already read, my name is Navid Khan. I'm 21 years old and 
                    studying my third year of Software Engineering at Western University. I found a passion in
                tech ever since I was a kid trying to fix our old desktop. I've been coding for over 5 years now
            and am experienced in multiple different languages and frameworks. Over the past couple of years I also gained
        a hobby in design and am currently the Graphic Designer for one of the largest clubs on campus. 
    My future aspirations would be to work in the technological side of either the Fintech or Transportation industry. 
Feel free to look around my website and please reach out if you think I am a suitable fit for your company and its environment</p>
